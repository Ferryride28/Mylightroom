LR Lite â€” PWA (Touch Optimized)
===============================
- index.html            (app)
- manifest.webmanifest  (PWA manifest)
- service-worker.js     (offline cache)
- icons/                (app icons)

How to use
----------
1) Upload all files to a static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Firebase Hosting).
2) Visit the URL on Android/iPad, tap "Install" or Add to Home Screen.
3) Works offline after first load.

Local desktop use is OK by opening index.html, but PWA install requires HTTPS hosting.
